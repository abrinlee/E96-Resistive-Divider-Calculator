# E96-Resistive-Divider-Calculator
Calculates the optimum E96 Resistor values based on optimizing for minimum error

This is both HTMP and Python version of the code. It calculates the best resistor value from the E96 resistor codes for minimum error based on Vin, Vout, and Ibottom which is the max current you want to drop across the bottom resistor.

I wish I had written this 20 hears ago.

Hope this helps someone other than me.
